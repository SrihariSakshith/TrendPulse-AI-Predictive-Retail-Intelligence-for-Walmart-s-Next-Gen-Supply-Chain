An AI engine that analyzes live Google Trends to predict viral product demand and automate intelligent inventory decisions for Walmart’s next-gen supply chain.

💡 The Problem: Supply Chain Lag

In today's market, demand is driven by unpredictable viral trends. Traditional inventory systems are reactive, relying on historical sales data. This creates a critical supply chain lag, leaving Walmart one step behind the customer. By the time a product's popularity is confirmed by sales reports, the initial demand spike has passed, leading to:

Stock-Outs on the hottest items.

Missed Revenue and frustrated customers.

Inefficient Capital tied up in overstocked, fading trends.

🚀 The Solution: Predictive Intelligence

TrendPulse AI transforms Walmart's inventory management from reactive to proactive. It closes the supply chain lag by quantifying a product's "viral momentum" before it results in a stock-out.

Our engine fuses internal sales data with live, external Google Trends data to generate a proprietary "Viral Score". This score predicts future demand and triggers our automated Decision Engine, which then recommends the smartest logistical action—all before the competition can even react.

✨ Key Features

Proprietary "Viral Score" AI: A unique algorithm combining Trend Velocity and Sales Momentum into a single, powerful metric to rank at-risk products.

Automated Decision Engine: The system intelligently chooses between two actions:

Smart Inter-Store Transfers: Automatically finds the nearest store with a healthy surplus to transfer stock, optimizing logistics and using existing assets first.

Manufacturer Replenishment: When no suitable surplus is found, it smartly defaults to recommending a purchase order from the Distribution Center.

Live Gemini AI Opportunity Analysis: Detects emerging trends for products Walmart doesn't even stock yet. With one click, it uses Google's Generative AI to provide a live market analysis, classifying the opportunity and suggesting a strategic course of action.

Dynamic International Simulation: The backend runs a "digital twin" of a global store network, proving the model's scalability and providing a rich, dynamic environment for data generation.

Interactive Dashboard & Visualization: A polished frontend built with React, featuring a ranked alert dashboard, predictive graphs, and an interactive map that visualizes the recommended stock transfer routes.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

The project follows a modern, decoupled architecture with a Python backend serving a React frontend.

System Flow:
Frontend (React) ↔ Backend API (FastAPI) ↔ External Services (Google Trends, Gemini AI)

Category	Technology
Backend	Python, FastAPI, Pytrends (for Google Trends data), Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro), Pandas, Haversine
Frontend	React (Vite), Material-UI (MUI), MapLibre GL (for interactive maps), Recharts (for data viz), Framer Motion
Dev Tools	Uvicorn, Git, Visual Studio Code
